Before you lies the technical report of “Remote Water Sensing using UAVS”, it has been written to fulfill the graduation requirements of the Applied Computer Science Program at the Saxion University of Applied Sciences. I was engaged in this project from February to June 2022.\\

The project was undertaken at the request of Harry Futselaar of the International Water Technology research group. As it took place in Vietnam and the COVID-19 pandemic was still going on, the project suffered some delays from administrative work. Thankfully, some useful work could still be done in the time I spent working on the project in the Netherlands, which has caused the project to go smoothly in Vietnam.\\

I would like to thank my university supervisors, Ronald Tangelder and Harry Futselaar for their excellent guidance during this process. I also wish to thank Tran Thanh Nam for the advice he has given me during the project, as well as the countless lecturers and students from Ton Duc Thang University that assisted to make this project become a reality. Lastly, I thank PERNAM JSC and their employees for the close cooperation we had.
