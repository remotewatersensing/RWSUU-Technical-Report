\section{Conclusion}
The purpose of this project was to find out what the best way is to build a mobile surface water quality sensoring system that can take samples in remote areas. Based on the preliminary research, design, and testing that has been done during this project, it can be concluded that there are multiple options for such a system to be realized. The sensors used were accurate enough to prove useful. Furthermore, the software that has been created proved to be of use. Future exploration into decreasing the size and weight of the sensor package can prove of use as the drone is too unstable to perform any measurements at this point in time. Unrealized subjects like secchi disk turbidity measurements and near infrared cameras  as mentioned in the preliminary research report could be realized as complementary or alternative options to take remote samples.
