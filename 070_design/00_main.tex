\section{Design}
In this section, an overview of the working architecture is be designed, along with several prototypes. This design report references a lot of findings from the preliminary research report.

Sensors will be selected to measure variables referenced in the preliminary research report based on their accuracy and capability to mount on a drone. A suitable drone will be chosen and modelled. Configurations of sensors on the drone will be designed and illustrated.
