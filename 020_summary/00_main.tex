\section*{Summary}
The aim of this project was to explore ways to measure water quality parameters using unmanned aerial vehicles. Prototypes were designed and realised, and these prototypes were tested based on qualitative and quantitative parameters. In the end, a foundation was established that made autonomous water quality monitoring a step closer to reality. 

Recommendations are to work more on creating a smaller and lighter sensor package so that the drone can fly more stable.
