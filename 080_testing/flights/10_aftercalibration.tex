The goal of this flight was to check if the drone was in fully working order after the trip to Vietnam. The drone was updated to the latest available firmware. The drone's compass, the gyroscope, and the \gls{IMU} was fully calibrated using the instructions in the user manual. \cite{splashdronemanual} The calibration itself turned out to be a challenge as a level surface was required, and this was not directly available at the testing site.\\

After finding a level surface and calibrating the drone however, it flew without any issues. The drone was able to land and take off in the water. \\

As the drone had to land in the water, the drone's antennas were place in an upward position for it to have signal. This means the maximum altitude without signal problems was noticeably reduced.
