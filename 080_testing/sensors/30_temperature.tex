\subsubsection{Temperature}
As mentioned in the Design Report, the DFRobot DFR0198/DS18B20 \cite{DFR0198} waterproof sensor was chosen to measure the temperature. Temperature readings of the water are both recorded and used to help determining the acidity and conductivity.

Temperature readings are compared from the Hanna pH sensor and the DFRobot DS18B20 sensor. The Hanna sensor has an accuracy of 1℃ and the DFRobot sensor has an accuracy of 0.5 ℃  The results can be seen in the graph below.

As seen in the graph above, all samples could fall within both error ranges. As the Hanna sensor has a temperature accuracy of only 1℃ it is not possible to determine whether the DFRobot sensor is acting
