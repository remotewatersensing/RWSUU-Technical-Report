\section{Introduction}
Intelligent surface water treatment can be a valuable asset to reduce the need for ground water extraction. A typical challenge of surface water treatment is determining the quality of the input water. The objective during this graduation project is to explore new ways in which this water can be autonomously monitored in local, remote, and harder to measure locations. Specifically, this project will be taking a look at the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to do this task. 

While it is not possible to know in advance exactly what the end product would entail, it would allow users to measure various water quality variables across an area by using unmanned aerial vehicles and various different water quality sensor concepts. Future projects could mature by for example improving a specific sensor concept or by spotting data trends to automatically determine the best filtration settings.

\subsection{The Research Problem}

The research question that the project will make an attempt to answer is as follows:\vspace{3mm}
